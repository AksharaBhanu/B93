page object model (POM)
this is one of the java design pattern used in selenium to handle StaleElementReferanceException

1. we declare the element using @FindBy (FindBy Annotation)
2. syntax:
	@FindBy(locator="value")
        private WebElement elementName;
3. How to initalize?
   PageFactory.initElements(WebDriver,POMclassObject);// inside constructor

4. no changes in the method

5. POM class can handle only SERE and not other exceptions like NSEE

6. if we dont use initElements method of PageFactory class what happens?
   we get NullPointerException

7.how do u handle multiple elements unsing POM? (findElements)
  in @FindBy use the data type as List<WebElement>

8. POM  class is also called as repository class / element repository 

9. best practice-- 
  a.dont accept same argument mutiple times in same class- convert such arguments as global variables
  b.do not write main method in pom class
  c.all pom class contains parameterized constructor
  d. number of pom class will be same as number of webpages
  e. number of test class will be same as number of test case

TestNG is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit.
It's designed for Java, and it provides powerful functionalities for writing and managing test codes.
The "NG" in TestNG stands for "Next Generation." 
TestNG is popular for its features like annotations, running tests in arbitrarily big thread pools, flexible test configuration, and support for data-driven testing.
It also supports various types of tests like unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.
It's widely used in the Java community for automating large test suites and scaling up to support larger projects.
